## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Before I started implementing this project I took some time to plan out the layout / components on a piece of paper which really helped me putting this together. I should keep doing that.

### Continued development

There's still so much to learn about React, I just started with it about a week ago.

### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp - How to validate Forms in React](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-validate-forms-in-react/) - I used this helpful tutorial to implement the form validation and error messages
